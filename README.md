# Local manifests for Android P (Galaxy J5)

j5nlte specifically. It isn't hard to add other variants yourself. These manifests are updated weekly or monthly, either bug fixes or tweaks.

What's different about this repo than the Galaxy-MSM8916 one? Well, this one is being updated much more frequently. Also, I add new ROM manifests (usually untested).

PRs/issues are accepted!
