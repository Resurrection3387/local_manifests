# local_manifests
Local manifests for j5nlte specifically. It isn't too hard to add other variants yourself.
These manifests are updated daily or weekly, either bug fixes or tweaks.

What's different about this repo than the Galaxy-MSM8916 one? Well, this one is being updated much more frequently AND I am adding new ROM manifests if they are compatible and work.
