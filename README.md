# Local manifests for Android 10 (Galaxy J5)
j5nlte specifically, although it's easy to add other variants yourself.
These manifests are updated once in a while.

What's different about this repo than the Galaxy-MSM8916 one? Well, this one is being updated much more frequently. Also, I add new ROM manifests (usually untested though). PRs/issues are accepted!

P.S. Yes, Android 10 for J5 2015 works now! All credits go to @jenslody.
